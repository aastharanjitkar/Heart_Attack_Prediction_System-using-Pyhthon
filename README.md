# Heart_Attack_Prediction_System
A heart attack occurs when blood flow to part of the heart muscle is blocked, often due to a blood clot, leading to potential damage or death. Cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks, are the leading global cause of death, making early prediction vital. This include learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), to predict heart attacks by analyzing patient data, including lifestyle choices, hereditary factors, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.

# Dataset Information:
The dataset comprises 1,319 rows and 9 columns, with the Output column serving as the label. The data includes numerical variables, capturing various health metrics and factors related to heart attack risk.

# Methodology:
Requirements analysis involved collecting and analyzing vital sign data. Machine learning algorithms, specifically Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression, were selected and implemented in Python to develop the predictive model. Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis using libraries such as scikit-learn were employed to enhance model performance and derive insights. The Flask framework was used to build a web API for integrating the model into healthcare systems, enabling real-time risk assessment. Continuous monitoring ensured the model's ongoing effectiveness.

# Result
The dataset was trained and tested using Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression algorithms. Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 79.9%, while Support Vector Machines had an accuracy of 62.1%.
